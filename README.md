## Fixing HiDpi Scaling

Used https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi script to enable HiDpi scalling
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi/master/hidpi.sh)"
```
## What doesn't work
- Obviously SD card reader
- Smart card has been recogonized as USB devices- no clue how to use it
- need to swapout the wireless card with compatible one..
- need some fix up for HiDpi scalling.
